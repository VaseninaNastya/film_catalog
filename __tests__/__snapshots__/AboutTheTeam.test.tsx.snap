      Vasenina Nastya
    </h2>
    <p>
      I worked as a civil engineer from 2012 to 2020. 
      <br />
      Then, from March 2021 to August 2021, I worked as an HTML coder. 
      <br />
      From 2019 to 2021 I have been studying JavaScript. 
      <br />
      In my free time I like to program, run, meet friends, go to museums and ride a bike.
